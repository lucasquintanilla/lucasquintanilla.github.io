                loading="lazy"> -->

              <p class="text-secondary">Lucas Quintanilla was born in 1994 in Buenos Aires, Argentina. From an early
                age, he displayed a strong curiosity for science, technology and artistic expressions.
                </br></br>
                His educational
                journey began at Saint Boniface Technological Institute. Graduated as a Electro-Mechanical Technician in
                2011, he developed a solid understanding of technical concepts in the area of electromechanics, science
                and maths developing his problem-solving and analytical thinking capabilities.
                </br></br>
                Motivated by his passion
                for technology, he pursued a degree in Information Systems Engineering at the National Technological
                University of Argentina specializing in Computer Systems Design. While studying and in his early 18
                years he started working as a Sales Representative for Maxdream, a national travel company, where he
                developed strong communication skills, negotiation techniques, and customer relations expertise.
                Following his passion for technology, he started to show his studies working at the British Hospital of
                Buenos Aires as a Computer Technician in the Technological Department, at the age of 21 years old. This
                role refined his troubleshooting abilities, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills in a critical
                and high-pressure environment. He fully embraced his passion for computer systems, beginning a career as
                a Software Engineer at his 23. During this time, he worked on innovative digital solutions. His strong
                analytical approach allowed him to excel in systems analysis and design.

                </br></br>Driven by his curiosity for
                innovation, Lucas also interiorises in solar energy and their applications as a sustainable energy
                source. His critical thinking and problem-solving mindset extend beyond technology—he enjoys questioning
                life and the universe, thinking outside the box, and seeing things from different perspectives.
                Motivated by the increase of crime in Argentina he started to work for a Security Company that supplies
                technology to the national government and national organizations, where he was instructed on high-end
                militar technologies. He became increasingly interested in emerging technologies, particularly
                artificial intelligence, recognizing its transformative potential.

                </br></br>
                Beyond technology, Lucas has always
                been deeply involved in the music scene. He studied electronic music production in 2012, having played
                guitar since the age of 12 and his passion for music led him to form a rock band at his 20. He also
                worked as a private guitar teacher. In search of new opportunities, Lucas moved to Dublin, Ireland,
                determined to advance his career in technology. Inspired by the city's creative and tech scene, he began
                envisioning a platform that would merge art and technology, fostering collaboration and innovation. “I
                believe Dublin is a prime example of a city where tech and art cultures converge.“ “In an era where
                technology predominates, human expressions are essential to maintaining a balance.” As the Founder &
                Director of Technology at CreativeClub, Lucas combines his expertise in technology, and creative
                innovation. His multidisciplinary background in technology, music, and engineering allows him to lead
                the digital and technical aspects of the platform, shaping it into a dynamic space for creators. With a
                vision that fuses art and technology, Lucas is committed to building a collaborative, forward-thinking
                community that empowers artists, musicians, and innovators.</p>

Hi Bambino's Team,

I'm impressed how the vision of bringing NYC pizza slices became a thing arounds the streets of Dublin.
Always when I pass at the front of the Stephen Street shop I see lots of people queueing waiting to enjoy what I believe, 
it's one of the best experience of the city center, for at least a few minutes of their lifes.

I shocked when realized there is no app for online ordering.
As winter starts to kick harder people tends to stay more at their cozy homes, 
ordering their meals online and avoinding the low temperatures from outside.
Having this in mind I believe Bambino's need to have an approach for online ordering 

Because of this Creative Club wants to bring a solution that integrates an online store 
along with a modern style keeping a high standard customer experience but without the higher costs of maintaining an traditional online shop.

Here you can find a demo to interect with.

I'm open for a chat during this week if this is of your interest.
Any feedback is always welcome 

Best Regards,

Hi Bambino’s Team,

I’m truly inspired by how Bambino’s has brought a slice of New York to the streets of Dublin. 
Every time I pass your Stephen Street shop, I see crowds eagerly lining up, waiting for what I believe is one of the best pizza experiences in the city center. 

I was surprised to discover that Bambino’s doesn’t yet offer an online ordering option. 
With winter settling in, many people are choosing to stay warm at home, turning to online ordering to enjoy their favorite meals without braving the cold. 

I believe an online platform would allow Bambino’s to reach these customers where they are.

We are is excited to offer a solution that can bring Bambino’s iconic experience online. 
Our approach combines a modern, user-friendly online store that preserves the high standards of Bambino’s brand, without the traditional high maintenance costs of a full online shop. 
We believe this will make it easy for customers to enjoy Bambino’s wherever they are.

Feel free to explore our demo here

I would love to chat this week to discuss how this solution can support Bambino’s continued growth and success. 
Any feedback would be greatly appreciated, and I’m here to answer any questions you may have.

Looking forward to the possibility of collaborating!

Best regards,
Creative Club Team

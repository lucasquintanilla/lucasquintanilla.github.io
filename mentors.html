            <p class="cs-text">
                Inês was born in 1996 in the vibrant city of Macau to Portuguese parents. At the age of four, her family moved back to Portugal, where she grew up and developed a deep passion for the arts and sciences.
During her school years, she was actively involved in theater, dance, and music, performing in public as a dancer, actress, pianist, and singer. Her creative expression extended beyond performance, as she found joy in the process of bringing artistic ideas to life. Alongside her artistic pursuits, she studied Science and Technology in high school (2011-2014), which provided her with a structured and analytical approach to problem-solving and creativity.
Her passion for music led her to pursue a bachelor’s degree in Music Composition at the Lisbon School of Higher Education in Music (2015-2019). During this time, she deepened her knowledge in Composition Techniques, Musical Analysis, Orchestration, Music Informatics, Ear Training, Music History, and Choir. It was also during her undergraduate years that she began teaching, marking the start of her career in music education.
Determined to expand her expertise, Inês completed a Specialized Course in Masters in Music Education at Aveiro University (2020-2022). This advanced program allowed her to specialize in areas such as Music Methodology, Research Methods in Education, Psychology of Development and Learning, Special Education Needs, and Education for Sustainability.
Throughout her career, she has actively participated in music education and choral conducting conferences, further enriching her knowledge. Her experience extends beyond teaching and composition, as she has been involved in organizing and producing concerts, fostering artistic communities, and inspiring students of all ages.
In 2023, Inês immigrated to Ireland, settling in Dublin, where she began teaching piano and preparing students for the Royal Irish Academy of Music exams. These exams are part of a prestigious music education system in Ireland, designed to assess and certify students' progress in instrumental performance, music theory, and overall musicianship.
Inês is passionate about innovation and entrepreneurship. She has actively pursued knowledge in social media, branding and marketing. Through this, she gained valuable insights into digital presence, content strategy, audience engagement, and brand building. She understands how to effectively communicate and promote artistic projects, create a strong brand identity, and leverage marketing strategies to reach and connect with audiences in the digital era. Her expertise allows her to bridge the gap between art, business, and digital media, helping creatives navigate the evolving landscape of branding and online visibility.

She also strongly believes in taking care of nature and animals, aligning her values with sustainability and environmental awareness.

            <h2 class="cs-title">Lucas – Founder & Director of Technology</h2>
            <p class="cs-text">
                Lucas Quintanilla was born in 1994 in Buenos Aires, Argentina. From an early age, he displayed a strong curiosity for science, technology and artistic expressions.
                His educational journey began at Saint Boniface Technological Institute. Graduated as a Electro-Mechanical Technician in 2011, he developed a solid understanding of technical concepts in the area of electromechanics, science and maths developing his problem-solving and analytical thinking capabilities. 
                Motivated by his passion for technology, he pursued a degree in Information Systems Engineering at the National Technological University of Argentina specializing in Computer Systems Design.
                While studying and in his early 18 years he started working as a Sales Representative for Maxdream, a national travel company, where he developed strong communication skills, negotiation techniques, and customer relations expertise. 
                Following his passion for technology, he started to show his studies working at the British Hospital of Buenos Aires as a Computer Technician in the Technological Department, at the age of 21 years old. This role refined his troubleshooting abilities, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills in a critical and high-pressure environment.
                He fully embraced his passion for computer systems, beginning a career as a Software Engineer at his 23. During this time, he worked on innovative digital solutions. His strong analytical approach allowed him to excel in systems analysis and design..
                Driven by his curiosity for innovation, Lucas also interiorises in solar energy and their applications as a sustainable energy source. His critical thinking and problem-solving mindset extend beyond technology—he enjoys questioning life and the universe, thinking outside the box, and seeing things from different perspectives.
                Motivated by the increase of crime in Argentina he started to work for a Security Company that supplies technology to the national government and national organizations, where he was instructed on high-end militar technologies. He became increasingly interested in emerging technologies, particularly artificial intelligence, recognizing its transformative potential.
                Beyond technology, Lucas has always been deeply involved in the music scene. He studied electronic music production in 2012, having played guitar since the age of 12 and his passion for music led him to form a rock band at his 20. He also worked as a private guitar teacher.
                In search of new opportunities, Lucas moved to Dublin, Ireland, determined to advance his career in technology. Inspired by the city's creative and tech scene, he began envisioning a platform that would merge art and technology, fostering collaboration and innovation.
                “I believe Dublin is a prime example of a city where tech and art cultures converge.“
                “In an era where technology predominates, human expressions are essential to maintaining a balance.”
                As the Founder & Director of Technology at CreativeClub, Lucas combines his expertise in technology, and creative innovation. His multidisciplinary background in technology, music, and engineering allows him to lead the digital and technical aspects of the platform, shaping it into a dynamic space for creators. With a vision that fuses art and technology, Lucas is committed to building a collaborative, forward-thinking community that empowers artists, musicians, and innovators.
